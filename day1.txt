Hello
This is my 1st file.

GIT BASICS
--------------
1. Create a repo. on github
2. In your machine, open git terminal and clone it by the cmd : git clone <url>
3. git status
4. git commit -m "<your message>"
5. git push

git push - sync the changes to the remote repo on github

Those are the four main but there are other advance concepts too like git merge, git diff, git branch, etc
